At the time of this document's writing, the core purpose of this repository is as follows;
  > Develop a public repository showcasing a solid understanding of programming fundamentals, concept knowledge and core language competencies.
  > Over time, add completed projects to demonstrate successful application of the above in a real-world setting
  > Create a document structure for any relevant documentation further explaining what is housed within this repository

As a former EDI Developer who is returning from an "IT Hiatus", my professional objectives are as follows;

  3. Apply my skills and knowledge to create scalable, functional, intuitive software and applications that drive businesses forward
  4. Form professional relationships with coworkers and industry professionals, which fosters career growth, teamwork and productivity
