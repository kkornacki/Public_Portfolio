As stated on my resume, my last professinoal experience working *exclusively* in a development role voluntarily ended in 2017. 

I have worked on multiple smaller projects while at my subsequent employers which were centered around development - although those projects
were initialized by myself rather than my employer, and they were to improve the operational efficiency of the organization or company to which
I belonged.

That being said, this GitHub Repository is a *work in progress*, and is *only* intended to illustrate that I have all the necessary foundational
experience required to succeed in a software development or related role. This GitHub will continually grow and evolve as I work through my 
'refresh stage' as I am affectionately calling it.

I am fully open to starting in a non-development role (e.g. Quality Assurance & Testing) and working up to a developer role if that is the
path I must take. Progress is growth, and growth happens in stages.

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
