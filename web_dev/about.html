                <h4>About the Developer | Keith Kornacki</h4>
                <p>
                  I am a well-rounded professional who has worked in a variety of industries. I thrive when faced with 
                  challenges and perform well in both team and invidual work environments. Utilizing my knowledge, technical 
                  skills and soft skills, I always strive to exceed expectations, grow & develop working relationships and contribute 
                  to the goals of the team and organization to which I belong.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My end goal is to establish a lifelong career as a software developer, wherein I can contribute to achieving the 
                  established goals of my team and employer, by utilizing my current and future skills and industry knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am extremely interested in enhancing my skills with both the Python & Java programming languages, especially as 
                  relates to developing business software such as ERP systems, Java Servlets and other related types of programs. I believe 
                  Machine Learning and AI in general are amazing tools, and should be used to enhance the productivity and overall efficiency 
                  of developers (rather than simply replacing them).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Programming is not just a job - it is a way of life. As such, a programmer is always learning and growing in their role. 
                  We learn lessons along the way, and strive to become better than we were the previous day. My view is that we all start from 
                  the same point: zero knowledge, zero experience - and through opportunities and hard work, we become what we envision ourselves as: 
                  full-fledged programmers creating viable, functional, scalable software solutions for businesses and individuals. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I sincerely look forward to seeing what the future holds, developing new professional connections & becoming part of a cohesive, 
                  productive development team. This website will be continually updated as I grow personally and professionally as a developer!
                </p>
